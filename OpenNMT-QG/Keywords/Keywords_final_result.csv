"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old menThey were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60. And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered.",emotion seldom go unanswered state level quiz make irrational decisions approached prospective benefactors makes us gullible makes us empathetic help us host binds us together old forgotten memories emotions struck us college tech fest would later turn would go drives us tech fest old menthey would aid whole fest technical fest young guys words conjured undergraduate days target demographic soon found silver bullet rationality takes raise funds neither motivated necessary realisation minds ideas greatest strength even sponsor drawing boards commercial street busiest lanes biggest problem amass money went back school students back seat typical shop emotions come donate money school children turn emotions school back shop donate come children willing weakness view tough thoughts thing talked support species say response plea planned plan picture people part owner one included inclined images identify grandchildren expected events event education decided connect conjure cause beyond appeals appeal age 60 35 ,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"During my engineering days, i worked on few projects, that gave me a good feel and experience of the real world situations and problems. One of the projects was to design a 12-Digit counter to calculate the Fatigue life of a mechanical specimen. As and when the project progressed, the idea or the concept we formulated failed at many stages. We overcame those failures successfully by incorporating better methods and ways. One of the problems faced was that, we used 7-segment displays for displaying the count. But unfortunately we were unable to drive the seven segment displays properly for the required application. So, without losing hope, we shifted to LCD displays for displaying the count. At the final stage of interfacing the counter with the mechanical machinery, we noticed that the output of the sensor going to the counter was at a different range than the one we designed for So, again, we had to reconsider the problem and change the counter specifications accordingly in order for proper operation. During my final year of engineering, we had to do a project as a part of our curriculum. We designed a smart shopping cart for shopping centres which would reduce the shopping time of a customer by automatically taking the customer to his desired product location. The cart was also a boon for the elderly and disabled, as it used to carry the products automatically through the shopping centre. The first idea that we formulated failed miserably in the midst of the implementations. What we thought and what was happening were totally different. We then had to come up with a different idea for the same task and get the cart working. These are a few technical challenges and difficulties i faced. And i successfully managed to overcome those situations.",seven segment displays properly without losing hope incorporating better methods desired product location real world situations formulated failed miserably counter specifications accordingly smart shopping cart segment displays formulated failed lcd displays shopping time shopping centres shopping centre would reduce totally different technical challenges successfully managed sensor going required application proper operation products automatically mechanical specimen mechanical machinery many stages good feel final year final stage fatigue life failures successfully digit counter different range cart working automatically taking first idea different idea used 7 project progressed engineering days problems faced situations counter cart idea used project problems faced engineering worked ways unfortunately unable thought task shifted reconsider projects problem part overcome overcame output order one noticed midst interfacing implementations happening get gave experience elderly drive displaying disabled difficulties designed design customer curriculum count concept come change carry calculate boon also 12 ,Why ?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students.

When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions.

I think this is a mistake on my part.

"Back in the undergraduate days, my uncle wanted a cheap means to keep track of when his assistant would come into his cabin while he was away on vacation. He wanted something under 1k that would alert him whenever his assistant go into his cabin. With an Arduino and a couple of sensors, I set up a system that recorded whenever anyone entered his room.

Twitter was up and coming at the time and would alert you by sms whenever someone you're following made a tweet. So I set up two accounts, one with my uncles phone number registered to it and another one for the Arduino driven system to post tweets to. Whenever the system detected a security breach, it would send a tweet to the private account which would then alert my uncle via an SMS notifying the contents of the tweet, which would be the time of the breach.

"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old menThey were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60. And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered.",emotion seldom go unanswered state level quiz make irrational decisions approached prospective benefactors makes us gullible makes us empathetic help us host binds us together old forgotten memories emotions struck us college tech fest would later turn would go drives us tech fest old menthey would aid whole fest technical fest young guys words conjured undergraduate days target demographic soon found silver bullet rationality takes raise funds neither motivated necessary realisation minds ideas greatest strength even sponsor drawing boards commercial street busiest lanes biggest problem amass money went back school students back seat typical shop emotions come donate money school children turn emotions school back shop donate come children willing weakness view tough thoughts thing talked support species say response plea planned plan picture people part owner one included inclined images identify grandchildren expected events event education decided connect conjure cause beyond appeals appeal age 60 35 ,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Consider person A and person B want to get a flowery phone case for themselves, and both of them know that there is no way they can find it online, but is not impossible to find it outside if put in a little effort, as they don't exactly know which shop sells it. Person A tries to go to each and every shop to find that one perfect case for his phone, whereas person B gets a printout of a picture of that case, buys a transparent phone case, puts the picture to it and uses it, as it exactly resembles the case he wanted. Here what person B did was smart work and what person A did was hard work. Even though B finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas A was smart enough to do what he did.

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old menThey were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60. And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered.",emotion seldom go unanswered state level quiz make irrational decisions approached prospective benefactors makes us gullible makes us empathetic help us host binds us together old forgotten memories emotions struck us college tech fest would later turn would go drives us tech fest old menthey would aid whole fest technical fest young guys words conjured undergraduate days target demographic soon found silver bullet rationality takes raise funds neither motivated necessary realisation minds ideas greatest strength even sponsor drawing boards commercial street busiest lanes biggest problem amass money went back school students back seat typical shop emotions come donate money school children turn emotions school back shop donate come children willing weakness view tough thoughts thing talked support species say response plea planned plan picture people part owner one included inclined images identify grandchildren expected events event education decided connect conjure cause beyond appeals appeal age 60 35 ,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

"Back in the undergraduate days, my uncle wanted a cheap means to keep track of when his assistant would come into his cabin while he was away on vacation.

But that wasn't enough, he had to be alerted someone and his old Nokia supported nothing but text messages. Twitter was up and coming at the time and would alert you by sms whenever someone you're following made a tweet. So I set up two accounts, one with my uncles phone number registered to it and another one for the Arduino driven system to post tweets to.

"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old menThey were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60. And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered.",emotion seldom go unanswered state level quiz make irrational decisions approached prospective benefactors makes us gullible makes us empathetic help us host binds us together old forgotten memories emotions struck us college tech fest would later turn would go drives us tech fest old menthey would aid whole fest technical fest young guys words conjured undergraduate days target demographic soon found silver bullet rationality takes raise funds neither motivated necessary realisation minds ideas greatest strength even sponsor drawing boards commercial street busiest lanes biggest problem amass money went back school students back seat typical shop emotions come donate money school children turn emotions school back shop donate come children willing weakness view tough thoughts thing talked support species say response plea planned plan picture people part owner one included inclined images identify grandchildren expected events event education decided connect conjure cause beyond appeals appeal age 60 35 ,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

For example, the initial 'pick an option' questionnaire seemed to have repeated questions i.e the same question asked in a different way, from the other direction. It seems to me a way to gauge the internal consistency within the subject, the sort of coherent replies that he can provide, whether she is clear about what is being asked and how they are being answered. I myself found a little inner conflict when I found the same question asked in an inverted manner. A casual observation, but one that I had to write down here. Similarly, I'm guessing the written would features question asked in the video round but from the other side. Like weakness or something similar over in the video round and strength in the written round. But yes, I digress. Back to perseverance. The ability to stick with a problem till its bitter end is what I would term as my greatest strength. It's not something I consciously do but something that has been ingrained into me through long years of gruelling practice where I was forbidden from shying away from the nasty internals of a problem. I can't rest nor sleep until the problem I'm working on has been cracked. I feel physical pain if I force myself to let go of the problem. That's how dedicated I am to finding a solution. I might not be the cleverest person in the room, but given a problem, I won't rest until a solution is found.",written would features question asked observe greatly helps little inner conflict internal consistency within feel physical pain greatest strength would question asked written round would term greatest strength video round shying away shy away repeated questions questionnaire seemed pretty quickly nasty internals long years like weakness let go inverted manner gruelling practice coherent replies cleverest person casual observation bitter end also tend whether deliberate something similar problem till different way different direction asked strength whether way something problem direction yes write working try subject stick stand sort solution sleep similarly side seems room rest provide pick perseverance patterns option one might listen initial ingrained guessing ground given get gauge found force forbidden finding fail faced example endeavours e digress dedicated cracked consciously clear back approach answered accidental ability ,Why ?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"During my engineering days, i worked on few projects, that gave me a good feel and experience of the real world situations and problems. One of the projects was to design a 12-Digit counter to calculate the Fatigue life of a mechanical specimen. As and when the project progressed, the idea or the concept we formulated failed at many stages. We overcame those failures successfully by incorporating better methods and ways. One of the problems faced was that, we used 7-segment displays for displaying the count. But unfortunately we were unable to drive the seven segment displays properly for the required application. So, without losing hope, we shifted to LCD displays for displaying the count. At the final stage of interfacing the counter with the mechanical machinery, we noticed that the output of the sensor going to the counter was at a different range than the one we designed for So, again, we had to reconsider the problem and change the counter specifications accordingly in order for proper operation. During my final year of engineering, we had to do a project as a part of our curriculum. We designed a smart shopping cart for shopping centres which would reduce the shopping time of a customer by automatically taking the customer to his desired product location. The cart was also a boon for the elderly and disabled, as it used to carry the products automatically through the shopping centre. The first idea that we formulated failed miserably in the midst of the implementations. What we thought and what was happening were totally different. We then had to come up with a different idea for the same task and get the cart working. These are a few technical challenges and difficulties i faced. And i successfully managed to overcome those situations.",seven segment displays properly without losing hope incorporating better methods desired product location real world situations formulated failed miserably counter specifications accordingly smart shopping cart segment displays formulated failed lcd displays shopping time shopping centres shopping centre would reduce totally different technical challenges successfully managed sensor going required application proper operation products automatically mechanical specimen mechanical machinery many stages good feel final year final stage fatigue life failures successfully digit counter different range cart working automatically taking first idea different idea used 7 project progressed engineering days problems faced situations counter cart idea used project problems faced engineering worked ways unfortunately unable thought task shifted reconsider projects problem part overcome overcame output order one noticed midst interfacing implementations happening get gave experience elderly drive displaying disabled difficulties designed design customer curriculum count concept come change carry calculate boon also 12 ,Why ?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"I have made my fair share of mistakes during my lifetime. Fortunately they did not cause any adverse effects on my future. Instead I've tried to assess and learn from them so as to adapt and manage similar situations in the future in the right manner. I would illustrate one such mistake from my recent history in the academic forefront. An important part of working towards completing a group project in a course is working as a team of motivated individuals. I will keep my illustration generalized so as to avoid taking names. In my previous semester I was nominated as the group leader for one of my course projects. There were three people on my team including myself. Let's name them Harry and Brian for my example. Before joining the course, Harry was in two minds of being interested in the course or not. Being a good friend of his, he had approached me for guidance. Instead of presenting a neutral viewpoint, I attempted to convince him to take the course though a biased narrative. Brian on the other hand was interested in taking the course. Harry did finally choose to take the course. Unfortunately, he realized that the course was not for him and his interest in the course dwindled. This lead to him being dis interested in working towards the team project. Brian and I had an increased workload as a result. Being the team leader it was my responsibility to motivate and encourage my team to successfully complete the project. I worked on encouraging Brian to complete an additional amount of work since he was interested in the course. I helped Harry realize the bigger picture of all courses teaching something new and useful. Harry did finally complete his share of work although not too an optimal extent. To make up for this, I and Brian worked extra hours and managed to successfully complete our project on time.",courses teaching something new brian worked extra hours manage similar situations would illustrate one helped harry realize avoid taking names working towards completing working towards encouraging brian work since work although two minds three people right manner recent history previous semester optimal extent neutral viewpoint motivated individuals increased workload important part illustration generalized group leader good friend finally choose bigger picture biased narrative adverse effects additional amount academic forefront team leader team including course though course projects course dwindled successfully complete group project finally complete fair share dis interested team project worked brian working taking one harry team course project complete share interested useful unfortunately tried time take result responsibility realized presenting nominated name motivate mistakes mistake managed make made lifetime let learn lead keep joining interest instead hand guidance future fortunately example encourage convince cause attempted assess approached adapt ,Where do you see yourself in five years?

Instead I've tried to assess and learn from them so as to adapt and manage similar situations in the future in the right manner. I would illustrate one such mistake from my recent history in the academic forefront. An important part of working towards completing a group project in a course is working as a team of motivated individuals. I will keep my illustration generalized so as to avoid taking names. In my previous semester I was nominated as the group leader for one of my course projects. There were three people on my team including myself. Let's name them Harry and Brian for my example. Before joining the course, Harry was in two minds of being interested in the course or not. Being a good friend of his, he had approached me for guidance. Instead of presenting a neutral viewpoint, I attempted to convince him to take the course though a biased narrative. Brian on the other hand was interested in taking the course. Harry did finally choose to take the course. Unfortunately, he realized that the course was not for him and his interest in the course dwindled. This lead to him being dis interested in working towards the team project. Brian and I had an increased workload as a result. Being the team leader it was my responsibility to motivate and encourage my team to successfully complete the project. I worked on encouraging Brian to complete an additional amount of work since he was interested in the course. I helped Harry realize the bigger picture of all courses teaching something new and useful. Harry did finally complete his share of work although not too an optimal extent. To make up for this, I and Brian worked extra hours and managed to successfully complete our project on time.",courses teaching something new brian worked extra hours manage similar situations would illustrate one helped harry realize avoid taking names working towards completing working towards encouraging brian work since work although two minds three people right manner recent history previous semester optimal extent neutral viewpoint motivated individuals increased workload important part illustration generalized group leader good friend finally choose bigger picture biased narrative adverse effects additional amount academic forefront team leader team including course though course projects course dwindled successfully complete group project finally complete fair share dis interested team project worked brian working taking one harry team course project complete share interested useful unfortunately tried time take result responsibility realized presenting nominated name motivate mistakes mistake managed make made lifetime let learn lead keep joining interest instead hand guidance future fortunately example encourage convince cause attempted assess approached adapt ,Where do you see yourself in five years?

When I was in 11th my mother had a neurosurgery in which many complications rose. My parents were away and I had my grandfather staying with me. My mother was being transferred to another city where she could be treated well. I had my classes and coaching going on at that time since 11th is a crucial year in academics. I wasn't feeling very well as I am close to my mother and my grades were suffering. So when I got to know the news I checked for tickets on a whim and luckily 2 were empty. Everyone was telling me not to come as it might affect my studies but I wasn't being very fruitful by staying there too.

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old menThey were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60. And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered.",emotion seldom go unanswered state level quiz make irrational decisions approached prospective benefactors makes us gullible makes us empathetic help us host binds us together old forgotten memories emotions struck us college tech fest would later turn would go drives us tech fest old menthey would aid whole fest technical fest young guys words conjured undergraduate days target demographic soon found silver bullet rationality takes raise funds neither motivated necessary realisation minds ideas greatest strength even sponsor drawing boards commercial street busiest lanes biggest problem amass money went back school students back seat typical shop emotions come donate money school children turn emotions school back shop donate come children willing weakness view tough thoughts thing talked support species say response plea planned plan picture people part owner one included inclined images identify grandchildren expected events event education decided connect conjure cause beyond appeals appeal age 60 35 ,Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are.

"My greatest strength would be perseverance. When faced with a problem I do not shy away when I fail to get a solution. I stand my ground and try to approach it from different direction. The ability to listen and observe greatly helps me in my endeavours. I also tend to pick up patterns, whether deliberate or accidental, pretty quickly. For example, the initial 'pick an option' questionnaire seemed to have repeated questions i.e the same question asked in a different way, from the other direction. It seems to me a way to gauge the internal consistency within the subject, the sort of coherent replies that he can provide, whether she is clear about what is being asked and how they are being answered. I myself found a little inner conflict when I found the same question asked in an inverted manner. A casual observation, but one that I had to write down here. Similarly, I'm guessing the written would features question asked in the video round but from the other side. Like weakness or something similar over in the video round and strength in the written round. But yes, I digress. Back to perseverance. The ability to stick with a problem till its bitter end is what I would term as my greatest strength. It's not something I consciously do but something that has been ingrained into me through long years of gruelling practice where I was forbidden from shying away from the nasty internals of a problem. I can't rest nor sleep until the problem I'm working on has been cracked. I feel physical pain if I force myself to let go of the problem. That's how dedicated I am to finding a solution.

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are.

"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",team mates worked extra time generate much progress due regular progress check meetings team mates till progress made periodically could finally complete course called introduction team mates whole could team mated team mate know much cross check us chose randomly chosen prevent repetitions per plan orally assured oral assurances made sense integrate everyone going fine future plan first year became clear 4 students work amongst incomplete work also since time team check made course work know also worthy without wanted verify trust think teammates said sadly promised project profession proceed problems part others order one mistake met meet knowledgable iiit however group excited everything even end done divide decided deadlines control completed compensate communicate come charted bother believed bangalore area ,Why did you do it?

"A great person once said, the only true knowledge is the knowledge that you know nothing. To achieve greatness, we sometimes need to start over. We need to learn to let go of our ego and focus on our goals. When the mind is focused on the end goal, everything else becomes secondary. Working under someone younger would be a refreshing experience. We get to learn that age and wisdom need not always be in sync and that greatness comes from talent and effort.

"Confidence is when somebody knows his or her shortcomings and he or she is willing to accept any outcome which may not match with hisher expectations. A confident person is very well aware of the non-trivialities in any matter and can smoothly act on them . Confidence in doing any job is obtained when after practicing a lot he is sure of the outcome because the neural pathways are consolidated. for example a student is confident in taking an exam when he has practiced and studied intensely for an exam and he is sure he will be able to tackle any type of problem. Overconfidence is pseudo-confidence i.e pretending to have an upper-hand in something inspite of lacking substantial knowledge about that particular thing, an overconfident person is ready to disregard any non-triviality in any matter solely based on his false pretences that he can tackle any matter no matter how difficult it is.",lacking substantial knowledge matter solely based well aware studied intensely something inspite somebody knows smoothly act particular thing overconfident person neural pathways hisher expectations false pretences e pretending confident person matter confident willing upper type triviality trivialities taking tackle sure student shortcomings ready pseudo problem practicing practiced overconfidence outcome obtained non may match lot job hand example exam disregard difficult consolidated confidence accept able ,Why ?

"Life throws ample amount of challenges to you and you have to tackle them and go beyond them so that they do not affect your life at all i.e your past should not affect your future in any manner. You can learn from your past mistakes so that you do not repeat them in the future and also help others regarding this.

I was broke at that moment and was not able to concentrate fully on my studies and admissions to the post graduate college. But then only some friends whom i didn't considered till 3 years became my best friends, consoled me and were with me at my difficult time. So that was the biggest challenge I have faced so far in life and then only I learn some things about life which are as follows - 1. Never panic in difficult situation, be calm and cool as much as u can 2. Whatever is bound to happen will happen, you cannot control it just give your best and stay happy with what you have got. 3. Never think about the result, just focus on the process. 4.
