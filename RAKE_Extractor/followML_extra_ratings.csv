Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are.

According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers.

Consider person A and person B want to get a flowery phone case for themselves, and both of them know that there is no way they can find it online, but is not impossible to find it outside if put in a little effort, as they don't exactly know which shop sells it. Person A tries to go to each and every shop to find that one perfect case for his phone, whereas person B gets a printout of a picture of that case, buys a transparent phone case, puts the picture to it and uses it, as it exactly resembles the case he wanted. Here what person B did was smart work and what person A did was hard work. Even though B finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas A was smart enough to do what he did.
People say hard work pays off, which is true, but when needed one should be smart enough to get things done easily.

Are you a risk taker or do you stay away from risk?,"I would like to neither agree nor disagree with the fact that I am an absolute risk taker. I prefer calculative risks over instantaneous mindless experiments as these usually turn out to be successful and even if the dont they provide a chance to atleast traceback and determine where I went wrong. So that I dont repeat the same mistake again in the future. But when it comes to situations in which my the failure of my risks are likely to have an adverse effect on the others, I usually refrain myself from taking such risks and like to play it safe in order to ensure their well-being.

Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession.

When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end.

Hence, we divided the project work among ourselves depending on our interests. 2 of us worked on the technicalities of the project, one on implementation of those technicalities and while rest two of them helped in documentation of the project.

What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?,"I view myself as being more towards the reserved side than the boisterous, outspoken type. That being said, I can handle my own when it comes to social interactions and meetings. Being innately reserved does lead to challenges at times when working with people who are purely extroverts especially those who do not value everyone's view point or ideas in the team equally. This is due to an inherent bias on their part to assess the value of a person's ideas based on his personality type and make the incorrect assumption that an extrovert is a preferred personality to introvert. This would be a challenge since I would have to adapt my personality type depending on the people participating in the idea brain storming. I have worked on this but still have to learn a few tricks to overcome this challenge completely.

The second challenge would be the fear of humiliation or making a mistake, i.e., proposing an irrelevant idea to a group of people. I do realize this fear is largely unfounded as no idea is irrelevant or interesting unless put forward and debated on. I'm working on this challenge by purposely making small mistakes in my life so as to develop a better reaction and management for the times when real mistakes do happen.",Has anyone working small mistakes by making a better reaction and performance?,2,2
When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?,"As much I can recall, when I started learning guitar. I had joined under an instructor who would call me for 1 hour session once a week and teach me how to hit strings and all that basic stuff. I knew to master anything you would need to climb all the stairs one-through-all. But I was not ready to accept the fact that I actually had to put in a whole year of effort to just learn the basics. So I thought , things can be learned on the go too, by acting and not basically having a pre-planned road-map. And then, I started off with youtube and online resources and learned my way to hit chord for some songs on my own. Less than an year, and I started playing songs or may be hitting the right notes. So for me the take-away or think-outside-the-box was 'If it seems too much to have an experience of something early, you better get your hands dirty on your own, you will learn it the hard-way anyway'",what did you want to do to the stairs one ?,1,1
Are you a risk taker or do you stay away from risk?,"Yes I am a risk taker. In fact I belong from small town, so to do anything out of the box I took risk throughout my life.

How will you perform under pressure? Will it affect your performance?,"According to me, I can handle pressure well. It doesn't affect my performance at all, and in fact it will bring out a fighter out of me to finish the challenge in a better, optimized way.

I am very adaptable person, so I can adapt to any situation very easily.",How easily can you adapt to any person?,3,3
Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?,"About a few months back, I along with 3 other batch mates attended a hackathon organised by Mercedes Benz. According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers. This worked well and the judges liked our idea and asked to add more feature to enhance the in-car direr experience over the next couple of months.  ",what was the first self to our mind ?,1,1

Apart from work, I see myself as a more mature and calmer person five years from now.",How do you know if the project output is delivering the expected output and delivering out?,2,2
What are your views about further studies?,"I believe that whether this option should be pursued depends on the person and what they wish to achieve in their life. As for me, I want to know about more and more about things which I find interesting. I also think that I would love the interactions and intellectual stimulation that only an academic place can provide. I will definitely take up such an option if I get the chance.  ",What is the difference between academic and intellectual,3,2
Are you a self-motivator?,"yes, I think i am a self-motivator, let me tell you about my experience ,when i was in 12th standard i didn't study properly and got less marks but inside i knew i could have got a good score ,after that in engineering i keep on motivating myself. That is how i got somewhat better score.",what kind of score does you have ?,2,1
Are you a risk taker or do you stay away from risk?,"I would like to neither agree nor disagree with the fact that I am an absolute risk taker. I prefer calculative risks over instantaneous mindless experiments as these usually turn out to be successful and even if the dont they provide a chance to atleast traceback and determine where I went wrong. So that I dont repeat the same mistake again in the future. But when it comes to situations in which my the failure of my risks are likely to have an adverse effect on the others, I usually refrain myself from taking such risks and like to play it safe in order to ensure their well-being. ",Do you usually usually refrain like an adverse effect in order to ensure the safe risks,2,2
What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?,"I view myself as being more towards the reserved side than the boisterous, outspoken type. That being said, I can handle my own when it comes to social interactions and meetings. Being innately reserved does lead to challenges at times when working with people who are purely extroverts especially those who do not value everyone's view point or ideas in the team equally. This is due to an inherent bias on their part to assess the value of a person's ideas based on his personality type and make the incorrect assumption that an extrovert is a preferred personality to introvert. This would be a challenge since I would have to adapt my personality type depending on the people participating in the idea brain storming. I have worked on this but still have to learn a few tricks to overcome this challenge completely.

The second challenge would be the fear of humiliation or making a mistake, i.e., proposing an irrelevant idea to a group of people. I do realize this fear is largely unfounded as no idea is irrelevant or interesting unless put forward and debated on. I'm working on this challenge by purposely making small mistakes in my life so as to develop a better reaction and management for the times when real mistakes do happen.",Has anyone working small mistakes by making a better reaction and performance?,1,1
What are your views about further studies?,"I am pursuing M.Tech.

Give me an example of a time when you had to be quick in coming to a decision. What obstacles did you face?,When I was in 11th my mother had a neurosurgery in which many complications rose. My parents were away and I had my grandfather staying with me. My mother was being transferred to another city where she could be treated well. I had my classes and coaching going on at that time since 11th is a crucial year in academics. I wasn't feeling very well as I am close to my mother and my grades were suffering. So when I got to know the news I checked for tickets on a whim and luckily 2 were empty. Everyone was telling me not to come as it might affect my studies but I wasn't being very fruitful by staying there too. So within that 10 minutes I decided to skip on a test and called up my professors to take the permission and booked a ticket as soon as possible. I feel that it was one of the toughest decisions I had to take as it was between my mental peace and my academics. In the long run I never felt it as a wrong decision even if it was taken in the nick of time.,how did you compare to your mother ?,3,1
What is your dream job?,"My dream job is to be a pilot. In-fact it's been a childhood obsession, after my first encounter with planes. The fact that, I am flying among the clouds with only the sky being the limit is truly fascinating. True, it's got it's own dangers and precautions, but travelling around the world totally changes the perspective. I could cross countries and continents, in matters of hours. And the best part, getting paid for it. Gives it a whole new dimension. Unfortunately, this dream job will always remain a 'dream' to me, thanks to my eyesight being too shortsighted. So, here I am coding and writing software to become one of the many IT guys",Is the dream job a good dream job,2,1
What matters to you more - job satisfaction or salary?,"These two are very much interrelated, as low salary will affect your daily survival and low job satisfaction will end you in depression. So according to me bit of both is required. ",Do they affect the low salary satisfaction and low job in depression,2,2
How would you be an asset to this organisation?  ,"I might be an asset because I put in my best to any work I take up. I am not shy of speaking my mind when necessary take it well when any positive criticism is directed at me. I would not say that I know everything and I am always keen to learn more. I think this job will help me to learn more and therefore, I am looking forward to it. ",Does anyone know if this would be good for a beginner?,2,1
What is the biggest challenge you have faced so far?,The biggest challenge would have to be making my project members agree to a certain thing when we are modelling our problem in a certain way and each one wants to do it in their own way. But what I try to do is show them some results and get going in that direction.,what would have to be making your project ?,2,3
What was the toughest decision you ever had to make?  ,"One of the toughest decisions I had to make was to give GATE without any formal coaching.

Looking back, now that I am in IIIT, Bangalore , I completely regard my decision as a sensible one.",What is the best coaching for any formal coaching,1,1
Describe a situation in which you had to arrive at a compromise or help others to compromise. What was your role? What steps did you take? What was the result?,"Sometimes I compromise if some elder person or the person whom I respect wants something on which I don't agree.

Hence, we divided the project work among ourselves depending on our interests. 2 of us worked on the technicalities of the project, one on implementation of those technicalities and while rest two of them helped in documentation of the project. But each time we ensured that we discuss with each other about our work during our meetings in order to ensure that everything is going in a right manner.",what was the focus of the project ?,3,3
What do people most often criticize about you?,"Lack of time management, the reason why I didn't crack IIT exam",does it have time management,2,2
How do you define success and how do you measure upto your own definition? ,Success according to me is that you started something which you are scared of and you completed properly. According to me I've started and completed many things properly so I'm stand at reasonable level at my definition.,what did you do at your definition ?,1,1
What do people most often criticize about you?,"People often criticize me about my presence of mind and humor. I guess these two will make our day to day work much easier and better.

I was my teams favorite when I used to work in my previous company, you can refer to my linkedIn recommendations as proof of concept :). ",what do people often criticize ?,3,3
Are you a risk taker or do you stay away from risk?,"I am definitely a risk-taker.

One cannot move up the ladder of success without taking risks.

Also, risks make me work harder.",what do you believe will put me out of your ?,1,1

Since this organisation builds electronic components I will be able to contribute to the growth of the organisation. I also have good interpersonal skills and I'm a team player. This will help interact with people well and meet the deadlines for projects. All these qualities helped me achieve a lot of awards in my career and I would like to continue the same in this organization.   ,what can a person do with people who do not do with people ?,2,1
What are your views about further studies?,"I believe that their importance differs from person to person, depending upon their context , background and future aspirations. Considering the fact that my goal is to contribute to a company with a meaningful mission, I feel that work experience trumps the extra years spent in higher education.",what is your goal in education ?,3,3
Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. 
Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered. ",what was one of the events that were planned for school ?,3,3
When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?,"The last time I thought 'outside the box' was when I was a part of a project where I was supposed to be come up with a solution to show site-wide announcements to the users of a website. The traditional idea is to save the information, whether or not the user has seen an announcement, on the server in the DB. Given the large number of regular announcements, the large number of registered users and limited server capability, I came up with the idea to store the announcements in the user's device. Whenever the user would visit the website, they would be shown the announcements and the ID of the last announcement be stored in the user's device storage (localstorage). Subsequently, only those announcements would be shown whose ID is greater than the ID stored and the stored ID would be updated.",Is there a way to show site wide wide announcements,2,3
 Why shouldn't I hire you?,I don't give up easily on a thing. I try to explore all the avenues before calling it quits and sometimes it may result in time wasted. I realise that sometimes it's easier to give up because another way exists but I have a tendency to explore everything on a particular approach. I am trying to improve over it by taking it easy on myself if I don't complete a job and switch to next. as I am trying to realise on how wasted efforts are costlier. I have a short temper if work doesn't happen as it was supposed to happen. Earlier I would get worked upon very small things but now I have started practicing meditation to smoothen my transition and be more patient.,what do you want to explore ?,3,2
When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?,"As much I can recall, when I started learning guitar. I had joined under an instructor who would call me for 1 hour session once a week and teach me how to hit strings and all that basic stuff. I knew to master anything you would need to climb all the stairs one-through-all. But I was not ready to accept the fact that I actually had to put in a whole year of effort to just learn the basics. So I thought , things can be learned on the go too, by acting and not basically having a pre-planned road-map. And then, I started off with youtube and online resources and learned my way to hit chord for some songs on my own. Less than an year, and I started playing songs or may be hitting the right notes. So for me the take-away or think-outside-the-box was 'If it seems too much to have an experience of something early, you better get your hands dirty on your own, you will learn it the hard-way anyway'",what did you want to do to the stairs one ?,1,1

As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are.

Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.",Are there any progress check meetings assured that the progress meetings are going to get fine ,2,3
Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. 
Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered. ",what was the purpose of the tech fest ?,3,2

If he/she were an open, friendly, approachable boss, I would be a little more frank and specific about my disagreement and maybe go so far as to offer alternatives and suggestions.

So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers.

When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?,"The last time I thought 'outside the box' was when I was a part of a project where I was supposed to be come up with a solution to show site-wide announcements to the users of a website. The traditional idea is to save the information, whether or not the user has seen an announcement, on the server in the DB. Given the large number of regular announcements, the large number of registered users and limited server capability, I came up with the idea to store the announcements in the user's device. Whenever the user would visit the website, they would be shown the announcements and the ID of the last announcement be stored in the user's device storage (localstorage). Subsequently, only those announcements would be shown whose ID is greater than the ID stored and the stored ID would be updated.",Is there a way to show site wide wide announcements,2,2
What is the difference between hard work and smart work?,"I would like to give a small example. Consider person A and person B want to get a flowery phone case for themselves, and both of them know that there is no way they can find it online, but is not impossible to find it outside if put in a little effort, as they don't exactly know which shop sells it. Person A tries to go to each and every shop to find that one perfect case for his phone, whereas person B gets a printout of a picture of that case, buys a transparent phone case, puts the picture to it and uses it, as it exactly resembles the case he wanted. Here what person B did was smart work and what person A did was hard work. Even though B finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas A was smart enough to do what he did.
People say hard work pays off, which is true, but when needed one should be smart enough to get things done easily. There are many situations where only working hard would make one achieve their goal, though. For example, passing an exam. Being smart enough to cheat in a exam to pass is not 'smart work', though you pass the exam. Such work does not help in long term.",is it smart work,2,2

Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education. 
Appeals to emotion seldom go unanswered. ",what was the purpose of the tech fest ?,3,3

According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers. This worked well and the judges liked our idea and asked to add more feature to enhance the in-car direr experience over the next couple of months.
