59,Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

153,Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.","made, happened, failure, describe, decision, ","team mates worked extra time, generate much progress due, regular progress check meetings, team mates till, progress made periodically, could finally complete, course called introduction, team mates, whole could, team mated, team mate, know much, cross check, us chose, randomly chosen, prevent repetitions, per plan, orally assured, oral assurances, made sense, integrate everyone, going fine, future plan, first year, became clear, 4 students, work amongst, incomplete work, also since, time, team, check, made, course, work, know, also, worthy, without, wanted, verify, trust, think, teammates, said, sadly, promised, project, profession, proceed, problems, part, others, order, one, mistake, met, meet, knowledgable, iiit, however, group, excited, everything, even, end, done, divide, decided, deadlines, control, completed, compensate, communicate, come, charted, bother, believed, bangalore, area, "

According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers. This worked well and the judges liked our idea and asked to add more feature to enhance the in-car direr experience over the next couple of months.

Even though B finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas A was smart enough to do what he did.

224,What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?,"I view myself as being more towards the reserved side than the boisterous, outspoken type. That being said, I can handle my own when it comes to social interactions and meetings. Being innately reserved does lead to challenges at times when working with people who are purely extroverts especially those who do not value everyone's view point or ideas in the team equally. This is due to an inherent bias on their part to assess the value of a person's ideas based on his personality type and make the incorrect assumption that an extrovert is a preferred personality to introvert. This would be a challenge since I would have to adapt my personality type depending on the people participating in the idea brain storming. I have worked on this but still have to learn a few tricks to overcome this challenge completely.

The second challenge would be the fear of humiliation or making a mistake, i.e., proposing an irrelevant idea to a group of people. I do realize this fear is largely unfounded as no idea is irrelevant or interesting unless put forward and debated on.

I knew to master anything you would need to climb all the stairs one-through-all. But I was not ready to accept the fact that I actually had to put in a whole year of effort to just learn the basics. So I thought , things can be learned on the go too, by acting and not basically having a pre-planned road-map. And then, I started off with youtube and online resources and learned my way to hit chord for some songs on my own. Less than an year, and I started playing songs or may be hitting the right notes.

228,Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

229,When was the last time you thought outside the box and how did you do it? Why?,"About a few months back, I along with 3 other batch mates attended a hackathon organised by Mercedes Benz. According to the problem statement of the hackathon we were supposed to build something for the car of the future. So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver.

231,Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.","made, happened, failure, describe, decision, ","team mates worked extra time, generate much progress due, regular progress check meetings, team mates till, progress made periodically, could finally complete, course called introduction, team mates, whole could, team mated, team mate, know much, cross check, us chose, randomly chosen, prevent repetitions, per plan, orally assured, oral assurances, made sense, integrate everyone, going fine, future plan, first year, became clear, 4 students, work amongst, incomplete work, also since, time, team, check, made, course, work, know, also, worthy, without, wanted, verify, trust, think, teammates, said, sadly, promised, project, profession, proceed, problems, part, others, order, one, mistake, met, meet, knowledgable, iiit, however, group, excited, everything, even, end, done, divide, decided, deadlines, control, completed, compensate, communicate, come, charted, bother, believed, bangalore, area, "

258,Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

282,What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?,"I view myself as being more towards the reserved side than the boisterous, outspoken type. That being said, I can handle my own when it comes to social interactions and meetings. Being innately reserved does lead to challenges at times when working with people who are purely extroverts especially those who do not value everyone's view point or ideas in the team equally. This is due to an inherent bias on their part to assess the value of a person's ideas based on his personality type and make the incorrect assumption that an extrovert is a preferred personality to introvert. This would be a challenge since I would have to adapt my personality type depending on the people participating in the idea brain storming. I have worked on this but still have to learn a few tricks to overcome this challenge completely.

The second challenge would be the fear of humiliation or making a mistake, i.e., proposing an irrelevant idea to a group of people. I do realize this fear is largely unfounded as no idea is irrelevant or interesting unless put forward and debated on. I'm working on this challenge by purposely making small mistakes in my life so as to develop a better reaction and management for the times when real mistakes do happen.","ever faced, obstacles, ideas, difficulties, communicating, ","interesting unless put forward, purposely making small mistakes, purely extroverts especially, e ., proposing, idea brain storming, personality type depending, second challenge would, real mistakes, personality type, preferred personality, outspoken type, team equally, social interactions, reserved side, largely unfounded, innately reserved, inherent bias, incorrect assumption, challenge since, challenge completely, better reaction, view point, value everyone, people participating, irrelevant idea, ideas based, making, would, idea, challenge, view, value, people, irrelevant, ideas, working, worked, tricks, towards, times, still, said, realize, person, part, overcome, mistake, meetings, management, make, life, learn, lead, introvert, humiliation, happen, handle, group, fear, extrovert, due, develop, debated, comes, challenges, boisterous, assess, adapt, "

299,Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

Why?,"The last time I thought 'outside the box' was when I was a part of a project where I was supposed to be come up with a solution to show site-wide announcements to the users of a website. The traditional idea is to save the information, whether or not the user has seen an announcement, on the server in the DB. Given the large number of regular announcements, the large number of registered users and limited server capability, I came up with the idea to store the announcements in the user's device.

So I thought , things can be learned on the go too, by acting and not basically having a pre-planned road-map. And then, I started off with youtube and online resources and learned my way to hit chord for some songs on my own. Less than an year, and I started playing songs or may be hitting the right notes.

322,What obstacles or difficulties have you ever faced in communicating your ideas?,"I view myself as being more towards the reserved side than the boisterous, outspoken type. That being said, I can handle my own when it comes to social interactions and meetings. Being innately reserved does lead to challenges at times when working with people who are purely extroverts especially those who do not value everyone's view point or ideas in the team equally. This is due to an inherent bias on their part to assess the value of a person's ideas based on his personality type and make the incorrect assumption that an extrovert is a preferred personality to introvert. This would be a challenge since I would have to adapt my personality type depending on the people participating in the idea brain storming. I have worked on this but still have to learn a few tricks to overcome this challenge completely.

The second challenge would be the fear of humiliation or making a mistake, i.e., proposing an irrelevant idea to a group of people. I do realize this fear is largely unfounded as no idea is irrelevant or interesting unless put forward and debated on. I'm working on this challenge by purposely making small mistakes in my life so as to develop a better reaction and management for the times when real mistakes do happen.","ever faced, obstacles, ideas, difficulties, communicating, ","interesting unless put forward, purposely making small mistakes, purely extroverts especially, e ., proposing, idea brain storming, personality type depending, second challenge would, real mistakes, personality type, preferred personality, outspoken type, team equally, social interactions, reserved side, largely unfounded, innately reserved, inherent bias, incorrect assumption, challenge since, challenge completely, better reaction, view point, value everyone, people participating, irrelevant idea, ideas based, making, would, idea, challenge, view, value, people, irrelevant, ideas, working, worked, tricks, towards, times, still, said, realize, person, part, overcome, mistake, meetings, management, make, life, learn, lead, introvert, humiliation, happen, handle, group, fear, extrovert, due, develop, debated, comes, challenges, boisterous, assess, adapt, "

374,Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.","made, happened, failure, describe, decision, ","team mates worked extra time, generate much progress due, regular progress check meetings, team mates till, progress made periodically, could finally complete, course called introduction, team mates, whole could, team mated, team mate, know much, cross check, us chose, randomly chosen, prevent repetitions, per plan, orally assured, oral assurances, made sense, integrate everyone, going fine, future plan, first year, became clear, 4 students, work amongst, incomplete work, also since, time, team, check, made, course, work, know, also, worthy, without, wanted, verify, trust, think, teammates, said, sadly, promised, project, profession, proceed, problems, part, others, order, one, mistake, met, meet, knowledgable, iiit, however, group, excited, everything, even, end, done, divide, decided, deadlines, control, completed, compensate, communicate, come, charted, bother, believed, bangalore, area, "
375,Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

415,Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.","made, happened, failure, describe, decision, ","team mates worked extra time, generate much progress due, regular progress check meetings, team mates till, progress made periodically, could finally complete, course called introduction, team mates, whole could, team mated, team mate, know much, cross check, us chose, randomly chosen, prevent repetitions, per plan, orally assured, oral assurances, made sense, integrate everyone, going fine, future plan, first year, became clear, 4 students, work amongst, incomplete work, also since, time, team, check, made, course, work, know, also, worthy, without, wanted, verify, trust, think, teammates, said, sadly, promised, project, profession, proceed, problems, part, others, order, one, mistake, met, meet, knowledgable, iiit, however, group, excited, everything, even, end, done, divide, decided, deadlines, control, completed, compensate, communicate, come, charted, bother, believed, bangalore, area, "

468,Describe a decision you made that was a failure. What happened and why?,"In my First year at IIIT- Bangalore, we had a course called Introduction to Profession. As part of this course we had a project which was to be done by a group of 4 students. The team was randomly chosen and I did not know much about my teammates. When we met to work on our project, we decided that it made sense to divide the work amongst ourselves, in order to prevent repetitions. So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.","made, happened, failure, describe, decision, ","team mates worked extra time, generate much progress due, regular progress check meetings, team mates till, progress made periodically, could finally complete, course called introduction, team mates, whole could, team mated, team mate, know much, cross check, us chose, randomly chosen, prevent repetitions, per plan, orally assured, oral assurances, made sense, integrate everyone, going fine, future plan, first year, became clear, 4 students, work amongst, incomplete work, also since, time, team, check, made, course, work, know, also, worthy, without, wanted, verify, trust, think, teammates, said, sadly, promised, project, profession, proceed, problems, part, others, order, one, mistake, met, meet, knowledgable, iiit, however, group, excited, everything, even, end, done, divide, decided, deadlines, control, completed, compensate, communicate, come, charted, bother, believed, bangalore, area, "

Here what person B did was smart work and what person A did was hard work. Even though B finally got the case he wanted, he put in a lot of effort to do so, whereas A was smart enough to do what he did.
People say hard work pays off, which is true, but when needed one should be smart enough to get things done easily. There are many situations where only working hard would make one achieve their goal, though. For example, passing an exam. Being smart enough to cheat in a exam to pass is not 'smart work', though you pass the exam.

522,Have you ever had to sell an idea to your co-workers? How did you do it?,"The biggest problem with our species is that rationality takes a back seat when emotions come into the picture. Emotions, I'd say, are our greatest strength and weakness. The thing that binds us together and makes us empathetic, is the same thing that makes us gullible and drives us to make irrational decisions. 
Back in the my undergraduate days, we had to raise funds for our college tech fest. It was decided that we would go from shop to shop in one of the busiest lanes of the commercial street to amass money for our technical fest. We soon found that people were neither motivated nor inclined to donate money for our cause. It was a tough and necessary realisation. We went back to our drawing boards. We had to come up with a plan. We had to identify with the people, connect with them, conjure up in their minds ideas and images that would aid our cause. School, education and children. These words conjured up old forgotten memories in the young guys and thoughts of grandchildren in the old men(They were our target demographic. The typical shop-owner, between the age of 35 - 60). And that is when the appeal of emotions struck us. As part of the events that were planned, we included a state level quiz for school students. This would later turn out to be our silver bullet. 
From then on out, we approached prospective benefactors not with a view to support our tech fest, but with a plea to help us host the state level Quiz, which in turn was part of the whole fest. The response was beyond what we had expected. People were more than willing to donate and even sponsor the event and the tech fest when we talked about school children and education.

So, as was the case with all other teams, the first thought that came to our mind was self driving cars. Most of the teams started implementing their ideas of self-driving cars, but all in vain because lets face it building a self-driving car in 24 hours is next to impossible. At that moment, I parted myself from the traditional way of thinking about innovations and came up with an idea which will enhance the experience of the driver. I came up with the idea of sentiment analysis of the passengers in the car and thought of changing the inside atmosphere of the car based on the current overall mood of the passengers.

So we charted our future plan as to how we wanted to proceed with the project and each of us chose an area which we were most excited about without any problems. As promised I did my part of the work as per plan, but sadly some team mated did not meet the deadlines. However they also did not communicate this with the other team mates till the end. During the regular progress check meetings that we had, we just orally assured the others that everything was going fine  and even if it was not for some team mates they said that everything was under control and I did not bother to cross check. I think this is a mistake on my part. When the time had come to integrate everyone's work, it became clear that one of our team mate did not generate much progress due to which our project on the whole could not be completed. The mistake I have made here is to not verify and check the progress made periodically and just believed the oral assurances. also since I was a in my first year I did not know about my team mates and how knowledgable and trust-worthy they are. At the end, the other team mates worked extra time to compensate for the incomplete work and we could finally complete our project on time.","made, happened, failure, describe, decision, ","team mates worked extra time, generate much progress due, regular progress check meetings, team mates till, progress made periodically, could finally complete, course called introduction, team mates, whole could, team mated, team mate, know much, cross check, us chose, randomly chosen, prevent repetitions, per plan, orally assured, oral assurances, made sense, integrate everyone, going fine, future plan, first year, became clear, 4 students, work amongst, incomplete work, also since, time, team, check, made, course, work, know, also, worthy, without, wanted, verify, trust, think, teammates, said, sadly, promised, project, profession, proceed, problems, part, others, order, one, mistake, met, meet, knowledgable, iiit, however, group, excited, everything, even, end, done, divide, decided, deadlines, control, completed, compensate, communicate, come, charted, bother, believed, bangalore, area, "
